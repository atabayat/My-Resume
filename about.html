    <h2>A small summary about me</h2>
    
    <p>Hello there! I'm Ata Bayat, and I'm delighted to welcome you to my website. Allow me to share a little about myself and my journey that has brought me to this exciting point in my life.</p>
    <p>For the past 7 years, I have been immersed in the world of Hotel management and the hospitality industry. Working in this dynamic field has provided me with invaluable experiences, taught me the essence of excellent customer service, and instilled in me a passion for creating memorable experiences for guests from all walks of life.</p>
    <p>However, amidst my successful career, I've always harbored a deep-rooted love for computer languages since a young age. At the tender age of 14, I discovered my fascination with coding and the potential it held to create innovative solutions. This passion never waned, and I found myself yearning to explore this realm further.</p>
    <p>Taking a leap of faith, I decided to follow my heart and pivot my career path towards the world of computer science. With great enthusiasm, I embarked on a journey of knowledge and learning, eager to embrace the vast possibilities that lay ahead.</p>
    <p>One significant milestone in my pursuit of knowledge was completing CS50 computer science from the esteemed Harvard University. This transformative experience broadened my understanding of computer science principles and ignited an even stronger desire to delve deeper into the realm of technology.</p>
    <p>Continuing my quest for excellence, I am currently undertaking online classes for Web development with the incredibly talented Dr. Angela Yu. Her teaching style is both engaging and inspiring, making the learning process a truly enjoyable one. I highly recommend her courses to anyone looking to enter the world of web development.</p>
    <p>Through this website, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and projects as I embark on this exciting new chapter. I am passionate about exploring the endless possibilities that technology offers and leveraging my skills to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact on people's lives.</p>
    <p>Thank you for joining me on this journey. I hope you find inspiration, knowledge, and enjoyment as you explore Ata Bayat's World. Together, let's embrace the boundless opportunities that the world of technology has to offer!</p>
    <p>If you have any questions, thoughts, or simply want to connect, feel free to reach out to me. I'm always eager to engage with fellow enthusiasts and learners from all walks of life.</p>
